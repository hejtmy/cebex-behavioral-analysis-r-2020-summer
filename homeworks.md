## Day 1

### Loops and fors
Save the code into a file named [yourname]-looping.R

Set the seed to 2020. Start randomizing default normal distributions (mu=0,sd=1) of 100 values. When the randomized distribution has the mean more than 0.2 away from 0 (> 0.2 or < -0.2), stop randomizing, print the number of iterations you had to do and plot the histogram of the final distribution.

Set the seed to 2020. Using loops, randomize 1000 sets of two normal distributions of 100 values with mu=0, sd=1 and count how many times the means of those distributions differed from each other by more than 0.3. Output that value.

### Functions

save the code into a file named [yourname]-function.R

Write afunction which normalizes (z-scores) values in passed vector. The function takes numeric vector to normalize, and optionally mu value and sd value to normalize the vector around - if either of them is empty, then the vector mean and sd are used. The function should return warning and NULL if the passed vector is not numeric or if any of the arguments are non valid (e.g. mu=NA)
