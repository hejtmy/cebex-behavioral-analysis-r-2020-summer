# Introduction

The course ‘Behavioral data analysis in R’ is aimed at helping students to understand the whole data life cycle, from loading the data, preprocessing, exploring to statistical analysis and meaningful reporting.

This track builds up on the knowledge from Introduction to R course and focuses on how to use R during the whole data life-cycle. We will show you how to prepare data, how to do exploratory visualization and analysis, how to conduct statistical tests and also how to visualize the results. And above all, how these steps interact and why they cannot exist without each other. You can be sure that after finishing the track you will see data-intensive research as less complicated and quicker than ever before.
